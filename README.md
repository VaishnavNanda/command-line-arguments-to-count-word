### command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
### EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC,Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
#### Step 1:
Import sys module to use command line arguments.
#### Step 2: 
 Use the open() by getting the file name with "sys.argv[1]" which means the first index of given argument
#### Step 3: 
Iterate the content of the file using for loop.
#### Step 4:  
Split the contents into each line using .split() function.
#### Step 5: 
Iterate the list of lines and increment the value of variable (word) each time.
#### Step 6: 
Run the program by giving "python prgm.py EX12.txt" on the terminal.
### PROGRAM:
```
import sys
count = {}
with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        for word in line.split():
            if word not in count:
                count[word] = 1
            else:
                count[word] += 1
print(count)
f.close()
```
#### OUTPUT:

#### RESULT:
Thus the program is written to find the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
